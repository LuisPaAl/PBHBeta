# PBH-{math}`\beta`

`PBHBeta` is a Python library for **computing abundances of primordial black holes 
(PBHs).** 


```{warning}
This project is under development.
```

**Python 3.9 or later:** The betaPBH library requires Python 3.9 or later to be installed on your system.

```{note}
This code runs in any Python 2x and 3x. However, we highly recommend Python 3x. In the GitHub repository and PyPI package for PBHBeta contains the basic libraries to run `PBHBeta`, but this dependences need import into notebook or in the console to functions be available.
