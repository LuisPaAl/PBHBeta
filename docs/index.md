`PBHBeta` library is a computational tool designed for studying the constraints on the abundance of Primordial Black Holes (PBHs) and the power spectrum (PS) in cosmological scenarios with a non-standard evolution phase between the end of inflation and the Standard Big Bang (SBB). 

```{warning}
This project is under development.
```

**Python 3.9 or later:** The `PBHBeta` library requires Python 3.9 or later to be installed on your system.

**pip package manager:** The pip package manager is used to install `PBHBeta` and its dependencies. It should be included with your Python installation by default. 

```{note}
This code has only been tested in Python version 3.9, and we highly recommend testing it in versions higher than this (Python 3.x and above). The GitHub repository and PyPI package for PBHBeta contain the basic libraries required to run `PBHBeta`. However, these dependencies need to be imported into the notebook or console for the functions to be available.
